//
//  1 The rate depends on the time-step size: if the time-step is changed, the
//    rate should also be changed as a simple test is performed at each time-step
//    to see if a bond should detach. Hence, the rate is "per time-step" not
//    per unit time.
//
//  2 The detachment occurs via the active BOND's head connection, not the head
//    of the polymer to which it is attached. This allows more generic detachment
//    events than if we identified the detachment event solely with a monomer
//    leaving the end of a filament.
