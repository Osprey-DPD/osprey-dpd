// Constructor that creates a decorator instance to wrap a taForceDecorator
// instance whose data is to be accumulated. Both decorators must wrap the same
// command target instance.
//
// The wrapped object is stored in the m_pInnerDecorator member variable of the
// CCommandTargetNode base class by passing the pDec pointer to the base class 
// constructor. The newly-created object is stored in the m_pOuterDecorator of
// the wrapped object using the function SetOuterDecorator().
//
// This decorator calculates the work done by a force on the beads in a command
// target and stores the particular taForceDecorator instance in a local
// member variable. In order to do this, it has to receive a pointer to the 
// tacForceDecorator instance via the pForceDec pointer, but it also has to store 
// the outermost decorator wrapping its enclosed command target in 
// its base class via the pDec pointer. The label of the wrapped force decorator
// is stored so that we can check it still exists before trying to access it. It may
// happen that the user mistakenly deletes a force decorator before its data
// accumulation is complete.

// the same order of execution is used, and the last added decorator is executed last.
//
// Because the innermost command target object just holds the beads, the 
// chain stops when its do-nothing Execute() function is invoked.
