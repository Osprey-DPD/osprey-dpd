// Function that updates the state of all free active bonds, or monomers, and 
// polymers that represent fActin capping protein monomers. 
//
// Free monomers exert forces on each other when they are within range, and may 
// assemble into polymers. When a monomer is part of a polymer it is said to 
// be "activated". Once an active bond has been activated, it is removed from 
// the free active bond container. The active polymer it is a part of is then 
// added to the free active polymer container unless it was already there. 
// Hence, any bond that is still in the m_FreeActiveBonds container is by 
// definition not part of an active polymer and can exert forces on other bonds.
//
// Each active bond is created by wrapping it around an existing polymer that becomes
// the tail monomer of the bond. Activation occurs when a free active bond comes within
// a specified range of another free active bond, or the head or tail monomers of an
// active polymer, and certain bond type-specific conditions are satisfied (see the
// aeBondOnCondition-derived clases). The two bonds are then joined via their head and
// tail monomers. In the case of two free bonds joining a new active polymer is 
// created, passing the newly joined bonds to it. When a bond joins an existing
// polymer it is just added to the polymer's bond list and the polymer's head or tail
// updated to take account of which end the bond joined.
//
// Each activated bond exerts a force on its contained monomers (via their head and tail
// beads). Only bonds that have been activated exert the force, so we first see if 
// any new bonds can be activated and then calculate the forces exerted by the activated
// bonds.
