// Command handler function to wrap an Event Source Decorator (ESD) target with 
// an Event Analysis Decorator (EAD) so that events controlled by the ACN and 
// watched by the ESD can have their data sent to all registered EADs for analysis.
// Note that information flows in the following direction:
//
// Event --> ACN --> Event Source Decorator --> Event Analysis Decorator
//
// so the decorators do not need to pass information back to the ACN, and are
// prevented from doing so.  There is a 1-1 relationship between event types and
// ESDs, although many event types may be managed by a single ACN, and each one
// is mapped to a unique ESD. There is a 1-many relationship between each ESD and
// the EADs, as there may be many forms of analysis that are to be performed on the
// data coming from one event type.

// The logic for linking an EAD to an existing ESD is as follows. The user supplies 
// the unique id of an existing ESD, an id for the newly-created EAD, an
// alphanumeric key and any further arguments required for the EAD's analysis.
// Currently the key will default to the ESD's id, but in future it will allow
// an ESD to select which of several possible interfaces exposed by an EAD it calls.
// The default analysis is to pass the simulation time at which an event succeeds.
