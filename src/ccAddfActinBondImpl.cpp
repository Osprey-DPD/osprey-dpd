// Command handler to create a new type of active bond to allow the 
// formation of filamentous actin out of indiviudal actin monomers 
// (represented by the polymers belonging to the type specified by the 
// monomerName parameter). Each active bond, an instance of aefActinBond, 
// wraps one polymer of the specified type, and is capable of being joined 
// into a filament by use of the aeActivePolymer class.
//
// The polymer that represents the monomers in the active bonds must exist in
// the CSimState's data before executing this command. The ccAddfActinBond command 
// is used to perform this check. The actin head and tail monomers must be of the 
// same polymer type and are assumed to have an architecture of the form A-A, 
// although this is not essential. The head and tail beads in the monomers may be 
// any two uniquely identifiable beads in the polymers.
//
// This active bond uses a simple Hooke's law for the spring force applied
// to the beads in the head and tail monomers connected by the bond.
