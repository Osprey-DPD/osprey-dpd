// Command handler to output a message to the log file showing the percentage
// of the total simulation that is complete. The percentage is expressed as 
// an integer only. 
//
// If the CMonitor::m_RunCompleteInterval parameter is 0, the current time is 
// used to calculate the completed percentage and it is output immediately.
// This command then has no further effect.
//
// If the m_RunCompleteInterval parameter is non-zero, it means that the user 
// has issued an mcSetRunCompleteInterval command so we use the specified 
// percentage to determine when to issue the log message and schedule a new 
// command for the next interval. If the user subsequently issues another 
// mcSetRunCompleteInterval command it will change the stored interval and issue 
// another one of these commands. The original command will still be in the queue 
// however, and will be executed at the original time.
//
// If the user extends the totoal simulation time, this changes the percentage 
// of the run that is complete at a given time, but does not affect the sequence 
// of commands. They will continue to be executed until the simulation ends or
// the user disables the feature.
//
// The sequence of commands can be disabled by using the mcRemoveRunCompleteInterval
// command. This sets the interval to 0 and it is executed only once.
