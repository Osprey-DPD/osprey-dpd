// Constructor that creates a decorator object to wrap a command target, which
// may already be wrapped by other decorator objects. 
//
// The wrapped object is stored in the m_pInnerDecorator member variable of the
// CCommandTargetNode base class by passing the pDec pointer to the base class 
// constructor. The newly-created object is stored in the m_pOuterDecorator of
// the wrapped object using the function SetOuterDecorator().
//
// Are there any problems in passing a this pointer from an object's constructor???
